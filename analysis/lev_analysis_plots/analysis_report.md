## 1. EPSS vs LEV Relationship Analysis

This scatter plot reveals the relationship between current EPSS scores and LEV probabilities, highlighting how the two methodologies complement each other in identifying different types of risk.

### EPSS vs LEV Scatter Plot

**Key Insights:**
- CVEs in the upper-left quadrant (High LEV, Low EPSS) represent vulnerabilities with historical exploitation patterns that current EPSS might undervalue
- CVEs in the lower-right quadrant (Low LEV, High EPSS) suggest future risk based on current threat intelligence
- KEV CVEs (red dots) show how known exploited vulnerabilities distribute across both scoring systems

### LEV Recall of KEV Lists

## Method Agreement Analysis

### Correlation and Overlap

- **EPSS-LEV Correlation:** 0.695
  - Moderate correlation indicates complementary rather than redundant information
- **High EPSS AND High LEV:** 20,629 CVEs
  - These represent the highest confidence high-risk vulnerabilities
- **High EPSS OR High LEV:** 79,604 CVEs
  - Total unique high-risk CVEs identified by either method

### Coverage Analysis

The composite method combining EPSS, LEV, and KEV provides the most comprehensive coverage:

- **Individual Method Limitations:** EPSS and LEV each miss vulnerabilities that the other identifies
- **Composite Advantage:** Captures 79,730 high-risk CVEs vs 20,714 (EPSS) and 79,519 (LEV) individually
- **KEV Integration:** Ensures all 1352 known exploited vulnerabilities receive appropriate priority

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### üéØ **Primary Findings**

1. **Complementary Nature:** LEV and EPSS identify different types of risk:
   - EPSS focuses on current threat intelligence and exploitation likelihood
   - LEV leverages historical patterns and exploitation behavior
   - Combined approach provides superior coverage

2. **KEV Coverage:** LEV demonstrates strong recall of KEV vulnerabilities:
   - 89.9% of KEV CVEs have LEV ‚â• 0.1
   - Validates LEV's ability to identify exploited vulnerabilities

3. **Risk Quadrants:** The EPSS vs LEV quadrant analysis reveals:
   - High LEV, Low EPSS: Potentially undervalued vulnerabilities
   - Low LEV, High EPSS: Emerging threats based on current intelligence
   - High Both: Critical priority requiring immediate attention

### üìä **Statistical Summary**

- **Dataset Size:** 293,324 total CVEs analyzed
- **KEV Representation:** 1,352 KEV CVEs (0.46%)
- **Method Correlation:** 0.695 (moderate positive correlation)
- **Composite Effectiveness:** 79,730 high-risk CVEs identified (‚â•0.1 threshold)

### üîç **Actionable Recommendations**

1. **Prioritization Strategy:**
   - Use composite scores for comprehensive risk assessment
   - Focus immediate attention on "High Risk" quadrant (High EPSS + High LEV)
   - Investigate "Low EPSS, High LEV" quadrant for potentially missed critical vulnerabilities

2. **Threshold Selection:**
   - **Conservative Approach:** Use 0.1 threshold for broader coverage
   - **Focused Approach:** Use 0.2+ threshold for high-confidence prioritization
   - **Critical Only:** Use 0.5+ threshold for emergency response scenarios

3. **Monitoring Strategy:**
   - Track CVEs moving between quadrants over time
   - Monitor EPSS score evolution for high-LEV vulnerabilities
   - Regularly reassess thresholds based on organizational capacity

### üìà **Methodology Validation**

The analysis demonstrates that:
- LEV successfully captures 89.9% of known exploited vulnerabilities at 0.1 threshold
- Composite method provides 0.3% more coverage than individual methods
