pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run check-added-large-files --all-files # manual test



bash# Temporarily disable the pre-commit hook
mv .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit.disabled
# Now you can commit
git commit -a

Or commit with the hook bypassed:
bash# Bypass pre-commit hooks for this commit
git commit -a --no-verify
